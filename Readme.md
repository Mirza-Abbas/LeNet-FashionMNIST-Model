## Getting Started
This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the LeNet architecture to classify images in the FashionMNIST dataset. The model is trained and stored for future inference.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch (latest version)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Torchvision

## Installation
To set up the environment and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mirza-Abbas/LeNet-FashionMNIST-Model
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LeNet-FashionMNIST-Model
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision jupyter
   ```

## Files in This Repository
- **LeNet_FashionMNIST.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook containing the model implementation, training, and evaluation code.
- **LeNet_FashionMNIST.pt** - Saved PyTorch model weights for inference.

## Usage
To train or evaluate the model, open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook LeNet_FashionMNIST.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model or load the pre-trained weights for inference.
